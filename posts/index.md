## My Lack Of Truth
Dead God, I come to you in my lack of truth. I come to you in my lack of understanding. I come to you wondering if you're even there. Fear drives me towards you. Fear makes me avoid you. But, here I am. Willing to be open and honest about everything. Nothing to hide.

I come to you broken. I don't have any solutions. I don't have the answers. I don't understand why the Bible has to make you out to be so harsh. Would you rightly turn me into a pillar of salt? Or is that a myth to create the type of fear that lives within me? I don't know. I know I wouldn't want my child to live in such turmoil. Can you free me from this, please?

I come to you aimless. When I first wrote this page, I had a clear goal and intent. I scrapped the whole draft. I'm not going to act like I know what I'm doing. I don't. I think the best thing I can do is be honest. I just want to be honest. I feel the pull to stay silent as a method of avoiding hell. Would you cast me into hell for being completely honest and genuine in my search?

I come to you hopeless. I feel this might be a burden I bear my entire life. I am afraid of aging because with each passing moment I find myself closer to your wrath. The anxiety is crippling. Where others find peace in the way you destroy your adversaries, I find discontent. I find discomfort in the idea that anyone would be destroyed by you.

Lord, please don't destroy me.

## An Honest Search
I have had a lot of conversations over the past two years. When I thought I knew everything, there was no point in talking to anyone. But, when I recognized I did not have the truth, I took an interest in those who said they did. I allowed myself to take in information from anyone and everyone willing to share their thoughts.

One thing is clear: there are a lot of people out there that are smarter than I am.

In my search, I found a lot of people who I could relate with. People who felt like their mental health had be negatively impacted by faith. People who were unable to reconcile the acts of the Old Testament God with the loving nature of Jesus. People who were continuing to believe out of fear. People who dared to ask, *"Are any of these ideas harmful?"*

The more I dug, the more unsure I became.

The walls came up. *"Maybe you should just stop all this questioning and just believe?"*

But that would be cowardly and dishonest of me. If I were to turn back now I'd be doing so out of fear. I was scared within my faith and now I'm scared without it.

The truth does not shy away from the light of questions.

## With You By My Side
I want to go through this journey with you, God. This is not about getting away with bad behavior, and you know that. You know my heart and intentions. This is about forgoing everything I used to know to make room for the truth. I used to say, *"This is who God is!"*, and now I'm asking, *"Who are you, God?"*

I want to know and be known by you.

I hope to find you and bring clarity to my life. I hope to find confidence and assurance in my faith. I do not wish to lose the faith of my upbringing. And even if the evidence points me away from the Bible, the fear of burning might still be enough to keep me latched on.

I find these ideas so damaging God, but you're supposed to be loving. I find these thoughts to harm me and my perceptions, yet they are derived from your good book. Please, help me to make sense of all of this. Help me to find peace in my lack of understanding.

Lord, please don't burn me for saying the things I'm afraid to say.
