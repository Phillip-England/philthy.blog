## Cracks in my Christian Fundamentalism
In 2023, I started struggling with my faith. Looking back, the cracks were always there, but I could not see it at the time.

I became desperate. I did not want to lose my faith. It happened through a process of deep self-inquiry. In order to remain honest to myself, discarding my belief in the infallability of the Bible was required.

I wish to be authentic. And remaining in my faith felt dishonest to myself and others.
