## Why Am I Writing?
I am writing because I aim to bring hope and comfort to those experiencing the loss of their Christian faith. Losing your faith can be catastrophic. The amount of fear and isolation that comes with the process can leave someone wishing they were never born. And so when you feel alone, I want you to know that you are not the only one going through this.

I write so that you can know someone who's been through what you are going through. I remember feeling like my thoughts were being actively invaded by satan and his demons. I remember looking in the mirror and thinking, *"The thoughts you are having could drag you and your loved ones to hell!"* And after I boiled everything down into its purest form, you know what was left? Fear.

The fear of being punished. The fear of missing out. The fear of harming others with my beliefs. The fear of hurting the Christians who love me. The fear of misleading my child. And the list goes on and on.

I am afraid, and so I write to be brave.

I write to say all the things I've been afraid of facing for the past 2 years.

## Who Am I?
My name is Phillip England, and at the time of this writing I am 31 years old (born in 1993). I live in Tulsa, Oklahoma and work at a local Chick-fil-A. I have been a Christian my entire life. Specifically, a Christian Fundamentalist. That is, I believed the entire Bible to be absolutely true (despite never having read it fully). If I had to put a denomination on it, I think Southern Baptist fits quite nicely. But, my views did shift a lot throughout the years.

During my teens and early twenties, I struggled with a severe, life-threatening drug addiction. This set the stage for my deepened faith in adulthood. During the latter half of my drug addiction, I turned to God as a means to escape. Despite actively using drugs, I started reading my Bible and read through the majority of the New Testament. 

I'll never forget the moment I read the words of Jesus in Matthew 7:21-23. I had just gotten home from the movie theatre I worked at, and while everyone else was partying and drinking, I read:

> "Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ 
> will enter the kingdom of heaven, 
> but only he who does the will of My Father in heaven. 
> Many will say to Me on that day, 
> ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, 
> and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’ 
> Then I will tell them plainly, 
> ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness!"

This verse scared me to death. Up until this point in my life, my faith was always something I adopted from other people. But for the first time in my life, I took ownership of my faith.

It didn't happen all at once, but over the course of the next 8 or so years, I slowly got my life together. Christianity played a huge role in that.

But not everything that glitters is gold. Something can benefit your life in one way, while harming your life in another way.
