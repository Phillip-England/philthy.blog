## I Believe In God
I come to you unsure of where to turn with my life. I know I believe in you, but I also want to be open and honest about how I feel about other aspects of my Christian upbringing. Maybe writing to you will help to bring me some clarity.

I am not sure *which* God you are, but I do believe you are God. When I read the stories of the Old Testament, I read of a harsh war God set against his enemies. When I read stories of Jesus, I see in you love and compassion.

I find it very difficult to square these two ideas. I have a hard time submitting to a figure who calls for constant bloodshed. Who requires blood to grant forgiveness.
