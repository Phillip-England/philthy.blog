## Am I Capable Of Not Believing In Christianity?
Early on in my deconstruction process, I had a pivotal moment. I was already in turmoil over the outcome of my faith. I examined myself, and I discovered I held a multitude of beliefs that did not end well for most of mankind.

Verses like Matthew 7:13-14 really helped to shape this view within me.

<bible-quote title="Matthew 7:13-14" translation="NIV">
    13 “Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 14 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.
</bible-quote>

After closer examination, I found something which left me uneasy. I discovered I believed that people who did not think like me were destined for eternal torment. This was difficult to accept within myself, and I did not like admitting my position of arrogance.

Up until this point, I wouldn't have even called it arrogance. I would've just called it, "the truth."

And with this stark realization, came a very troubling question: Am I capable of not believing in Christianity for a single day?

I never dreamed of considering such a question prior to this moment.

## Leaving A Belief System Can Be Terrifying
After asking my big question, I set out to test myself. I was pretty sure I'd live through another day, and so what harm would a single day without my faith do? This led me to a concept called, "Barriers to Exit."

Most people have it in their mind that their position of faith is a free and open choice. But until one has attempted to exit their faith, they know not of the barriers which exist to keep them within their belief system. Barriers do exist, and for me, they played a crucial role in helping change the way I viewed Christianity as a whole.

At the heart of these barriers you will find a common theme: fear. Fear is the barrier which keeps people from exiting their faith, but the way this fear manifests can be highly dependent on your unique circumstances. 

## The Fear Of Causing Anxiety Within My Mother
God bless my Mother. I must've put her through so much trouble over the past few years with my existential crisis. If you ever read these words, know that I love you and am eternally thankful for all the conversations we shared. I know they were challenging and deeply troubling.

My Mother is a Christian woman who believes the Bible to be the infallible Word of God. As I began to wrestle with my faith, she was one of the people I confided in. I shared all of my thoughts with her, and I could tell my newfound apostacy was not easy for her to accept. She feared for my soul.

At many points throughout my journey, I've felt the temptation to lie to my Mother about my beliefs in order to give her peace of mind. I've thought to myself, "Maybe you should just believe in Christianity for her sake."

This was a huge barrier to exit for me. And this fear extended beyond my Mother. It trickled down into every relationship where God and faith were a component. The fear of causing my Mother anxiety in her moments of death tasted bitter. 

Barriers to exit.

## The Fear Of Being Deceived
As I tested my ability to forgo Christianity, I thought to myself, "This is exactly what the devil wants." And if Christianity is true, that is the case. If Christianity is true, my position of deep questioning and doubt would have the devil watering at the mouth.

<bible-quote title="1 Peter 5:8" translation="NIV">
    8 Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
</bible-quote>

"Am I going to be devoured?", I thought. "Does the devil have me right where he wants me?"

These types of thoughts were torture. The panic attacks were endless. Every time I got a slight pain in my chest I was sure it was the end and I'd wake up in oblivion in a moments notice. My blood pressure soared and I had periods of time where I checked it multiple times a day and that only exacerbated the problem.

In October of 2024, I burnt all the skin off of my left thumb in an apartment fire. This injury left me wondering, "Is God threatening me and trying to warn me about my impending doom in hell?" Then, people affirmed this with the idea that God might cause temporary pain in this life to help us avoid eternal torment in the next.

I think they were biblical in their interpretation:

<bible-quote title="Matthew 5:30" translation="NIV">
    30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.
</bible-quote>

It's been two years since I began struggling, and this fear lives with me each and every day.

## The Fear Of Leading My Daughter Astray
My Daughter is the best thing that has ever happened to me. She is such a better person than I am. Just the other day I was sick, and she took care of me with such love and patience. I love her so much. And the thought of her burning in hell sickens me. But you know what worries me even more? What if I am a stepping stone on her way to hell?

Me and my daughter have a very open relationship. I place a huge emphasis on trust and communication. I am honest with her about the darkest parts of myself because I want her to know it's okay to be human. She is aware of my struggle with faith.

For perspective, I still have my daughter going to a private Christian school. That is how deep this fear goes. I have open and honest dialog with her to help mitigate some of the things I consider to be harmful within Christianity, but I am still scared to take her out completely.

Would God punish my little girl if she followed in my footsteps and stopped believing the Bible to be the absolute truth about reality? Will he punish me? These are the types of ideas that result in therapy bills and medication, yet I am still scared to pull my daughter from her school.

Barriers to exit.

## The Fear Of A Worsened Punishment
I was born in Kentucky and I have lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma for the majority of my life. I have never lived in a blue city. I've always lived within 5 minutes of a church. If Christianity is true, I have no excuses. I have had all the opportunities to believe and to keep on believing. In a lot of ways, my life has been positively impacted by Christianity. I am without excuse.

And so, the following Bible verse applies to me:

<bible-quote title="2 Peter 2:21" translation="NIV">
    It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them.
</bible-quote>

If I die and wake up in hell, I cannot say, "I didn't know any better." I cannot claim ignorance, nor would it be any good to do so, I am without excuse.

<bible-quote title="Luke 16:23-24" translation="NIV">
    23 In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 24 So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’
</bible-quote>

God, I pray you won't leave anyone in such agony, even those who don't believe in miracles.
