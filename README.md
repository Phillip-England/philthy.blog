## Short-Term Vision

A website where I journal about my experiences leaving the Christian faith, so that others can feel they are not alone in their struggles.

## Long-Term Vision

Anytime someone wants to reach out and discuss these issues with someone, they should be able to.

## Blog Content

Each blog post needs to have a certain *feel* to it. We need to make a consious effort to connect the dots between blog posts by **linking to old ideas weve already discussed**.

It should feel like we are having an open conversation with our readers. We need to somehow get people in the postiion where they feel like they can reach out to me for help with their faith struggles.

### Post-Specific Content

Within each post, I need to include all of the following:

1. Bible Verses
2. An Outside Source
3. A Pun
4. A Link to Another Post
5. Things I would say if I were a Christian
