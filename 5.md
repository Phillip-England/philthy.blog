# The Gift of Eternal Life
*10/18/2024 by Phillip England*

I can't help but think my faith has taken advantage of my desires. That Christianity is more of a solution to my problems rather than an actual truth about reality.

What if our faith has made promises it cannot keep?

What if the reason Christianity is so pervasive is because it seeks to solve our deepest issues?

I want to explore this idea with you today.

## The Fear of Death

We have a survival instinct. This instinct, despite it's edge-cases, seems to be fully functional and rather good at it's job. But, we know this cannot go on forever. As I go on with my daily tasks, death stalks the ever-shrinking peremeter of my life.

This fear is pervasive in my life, and Christianity exacerbates it. Christianity has the potential to make death far worse than it ought to be. But in it's doing so, it also offers the remedy. Believe in Jesus and fear death no more. Even to the point of discouraging others from putting to much stock into this life:

> "For what shall it profit a man,
> if he shall gain the whole world,
> and lose his own soul?"

> â€” Mark 8:36 KVJ

## The Fear of Isolation

We are a social species. Community adds value to our lives. We see people time and time again placing thier biggest ambitions in causes which support the wellbeing of others. As humans, we seem to have an inner drive to want to help those around us.

But when we are cut off from others, we may lose ourselves. We may fall into depression and aim to end our lives to escape the struggle.
